								<h2>Next Bus</h2>
								<h4><a href="http://nextbus.kentc.me/">nextbus.kentc.me</a></h4>
								<p>
									I was inspired to make this after trying the Next Bus service provided by TransLink, the local transit provider here in Vancouver. <a href="http://nb.translink.ca/">Their version</a> does the job but I thought I could do better so I made my own using their public API.
								</p>
								<p>
									My focus for the app was to provide quick and easy access to arrival times. I also wanted to have some fun with the visual design and showcase that utilitarian doesn't have to be boring, and let's be honest, waiting for the bus is never fun.
								</p>
								<p>
									The web app was designed for phones running WebKit and is limited to residents within Metro Vancouver. If you want to make your own, here's <a href="http://developer.translink.ca/">TransLink's Open API</a>.

								<h3>Version 2.0</h3>
								<p>
									I discovered a neat little web service called <a href="https://www.webscript.io/">Webscripts</a>. It's a service which allows you to write short Lua scripts to handle and respond to HTTP requests. This allows a person like me to have an API server without knowing how to set one up. 
								</p>
								<p>
									My initial version was a bit hackish. Since I didn't have a server, I had use Yahoo Query Language (YQL) to make my cross domain requests. The result was sub-optimal to say the least. By switching to webscripts, I could now make and control my requests to Translink. I now had access to the proper JSON data rather than the JSON data that was converted from the XML data that YQL returned. I no longer have to expose my API key in the source files, which was bad.
								</p>
								<p>
									I also decided to tweak my design. I switched to a more standard app UI and updated the transitions accordingly. A new model that allows for quicker screen transitions but still providing the navigational affordances. I also replaced all my images but one with scalable vector icons. The only image now is my bus icon graphic. I use two web font icon sets, <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a> for my controls and indicators, and <a href="http://emojisymbols.com/">Emoji Symbols</a> for my error graphics.

								<h3>Version 1.0</h3>
								<p>
									This was my original version of the web app. I wanted to build a web app that made it quick and easy to get bus upcoming info.
