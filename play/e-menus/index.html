								<h2>Food Menus</h2>
								<h4>Refining the Online Menu</h4>
								<p>
									Go visit the website of one of your favorite restaurants. Now go and view their menu — was the menu written in HTML or was it a PDF? In my own experience, it's about 50-50. I understand why PDFs are used but they sure suck for the web.
								</p>
								<p>
									I must admit, I do appreciate the care and thought that goes into well crafted physical menu. However, I wish their digital counterparts received that same love and attention. It seems whomever is designing these websites, puts their emphasis on the overall site and not on the menu. They design for beauty first and functionality second. When I think of the reasons why I would visit a restaurant's site, it's usually for their contact info or to view their menu. That isn't to say your site can't contain other info, but that is secondary and so is beauty.
								</p>
								<p class="note">
									The content displayed in these menus feature the name and food of the <a href="https://hawksworthrestaurant.com/">Hawksworth Restaurant</a>. I have no affliation to the restaurant or its owners. I simply wanted to base my exploration using real content from a good restaurant serving delicious food.

								<h3>A Better Approach</h3>
							</div>
							<div class="content-display">
								<ul id="screenshots-1">
									<li><img src="play/e-menus/screenshots/menu-web-1.jpg" alt="Menu for large screens"></li>
									<li><img src="play/e-menus/screenshots/menu-web-2.jpg" alt="Menu for medium and small screens"></li>
								</ul>
								<nav id="screenshots-1-controls"></nav>

									A good website is responsive — the menu should adapt to the screen it's being viewed on. Also, it shouldn't be hard or complicated for the owners to change their menu. In fact, that should be one of their requirements. That doesn't mean the owners need to interact with the code — they just need a way to modify the data. Depending on the design and format of the menu, that data could be as simple as a Markdown file — easy to read and write.
								</p>
								<p>
									Food is such a visual experience — as the saying goes, we eat with our eyes. Pictures are also better than words — I've certainly wanted a dish just by looking at the photo, it can say so much more than text. So let's off your daily specials and your signature dishes. The addition of galleries doesn't mean it's difficult to manage, there are great services like Squarespace that use Dropbox to make it easy — just drag and drop those photos.

								<h3>So What About Print?</h3>

									<li><img src="play/e-menus/screenshots/menu-print-1.png" alt="Print friendly menu in portrait"></li>

									Well, if someone needed a hard copy, you could always use your existing PDF, or you can generate one — on demand. I've never had a reason or need to use the <em>@print style</em> until now. This lets you alter the format to better suit the needs of the printed page. Unfortunately, there is a mixed bag of results when applied across the different browsers. Nonetheless, the idea is still very promising.
								</p>
								<p>
									If you want a closer look, here's the <a href="sandbox/e-menu/">link to my demo</a> — see how it responds to different window dimensions and how it looks if you decide to print. By the way, in my opinion, Google Chrome currently has the best formatting and support for printing web content.
