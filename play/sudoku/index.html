								<h2>Digital Sudoku</h2>
								<h4>A Design Paradox</h4>
								<p>
									I've played a lot of Sudoku over the years and still do — it's my go to puzzle game. However, I've never been a fan of the pen and paper version, it just isn't for me. Adding and removing notes on paper is just so tedious and messy. I much prefer solving my puzzles digitally, where the experience is more optimal for the harder difficulties. 
								</p>
								<p>
									That being said, I've never truly found great a Sudoku app. Each has their own strengths and weaknesses — even the highest rated. While some stay true to the pen and paper experience, most have added features to assist in the solving of their puzzles. However, I find many of those aids to be ineffective or even useless. In my opinion, a hint feature that solves a given cell, ruins the challenge.
								</p>
								<p>
									The designer in me wants to think, why not remove the pain points that reside from the paper variant. For instance, what values are valid for a given cell — you shouldn't let them enter a duplicate, that's stupid. You can still mess up but it shouldn't be for that reason. When you also take into consideration touch screens, it's easy to miss-tap the wrong button or number.
								</p>
								<p>
									Another pain point, is finding and seeing the possible locations for a given value. Many of the apps just highlight the instances if they're present in the puzzle. This requires the player to visually line up the possible cells. What if you instead, displayed those possible locations — below is a prototype that does just that.

									This puzzle is classified as hard. It was generated and taken from this <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sudoku-+/id372283316?mt=8">Sudoku</a> app. You can use your keyboard's <b>1-9 keys</b> instead of the provided buttons. You can also use the <b>spacebar</b> to quickly switch between guess mode (blue) and note mode (orange). Select a cell that has a hint to see the possible locations for that given value.
								</p>
								<p>
									After playing around with this prototype, I stumbled upon a paradox. Is having the ability to easily spot singles and hidden singles detracting from the essence of the game? After all, it's suppose to be a puzzle. By removing some of the challenge, do you lose some sense of accomplishment?
								</p>
								<p>
									It's much like the instant cake mix paradox — it's so simple, you just add water. By removing all the steps, is that really baking? As sales flattened, companies made the process more involved, why would anyone want to do more?
								</p>
								<p>
									So now I'm unsure how I feel about these features. As someone who enjoys the harder puzzles, it certainly removes some of my pain points, however, I can see how this can really affect a player's experience. Yes, it takes away some of the challenge by removing the low hanging fruit, but hard and expert level puzzles still require more advanced logic. It was never my intention to build a feature that trivializes the process, but it does for the lower difficulties.
