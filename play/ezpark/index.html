								<h2>Street Parking</h2>
								<h4>Using Your Phone to Pay the Meter</h4>
								<p>
									This idea to use your cellphone to pay for things isn't new by any stretch — the Japanese have been using their phones as payment devices for nearly a decade now, even before smartphones were a thing. In the case of paid parking, it's a natural evolution to the standard coin operated meters.
								</p>
								<p>
									Here in Vancouver, it is such the case — we're able to use our phones to pay for our street parking via the <a href="https://paybyphone.com">PayByPhone</a> service. However, this service is far from ideal. You're probably thinking how bad can it be, it's a simple task that only requires a few steps. Well, it's not that people can't complete the task, but the whole process is rather tedious and suboptimal.

								<h3>Understanding Your Users</h3>
								<p>
									New or not, the process of signing up shouldn't to be your first step. Remember, the user is here to purchase meter time, everything else is secondary. Account creation is a convenience feature to the user, even if, it's important to you — the business. You should respect their time and yours. The faster you can let them complete their task, the happier they will be — after all, happy users leads to repeat users and happy repeat users leads to loyal users.
								</p>
								<p>
									Furthermore, a new or first time user is very unlikely to have your app already installed — especially, if they start at your website. Therefore, the web should be your default starting experience and it should not be a second class citizen to your native app, and vice versa, your native app should not be a rehash of your web experience.
								</p>
								<p>
									Each platform has its own strengths and weaknesses — they need their own design and tweaks. It's not that you need to re-invent wheel for each, it's quite the contrary. The experiences will be similar because the steps remain the same.

								<h3>The Web Experience</h3>
								<p>
									The first screen the user lands on should be focused around the entry of their parking stall. The other things, such as: sign up, login, company info, and app downloads are all secondary or even tertiary.
								</p>
								<p>
									You can still bring awareness of your native app, but it should be done so unobtrusively and not inhibit the user from completing their task at hand. Displaying a smart app banner that links them directly to the store is one approach. Another, which is more device agnostic, would be to place download links below the parking stall's input box.
								</p>
								<p>
									Once they've entered their parking stall info we can advance to the next screen, time selection and payment. As the user enters their payment info, it actually serves us dual purposes: one, to process the charge and second, to shorten their sign up. 
								</p>
								<p>
									If they do decide to create an account, all that's remaining is an email and password — the rest, we already have. That info can be automatically pre-filled for the user.

								<h3>The Native Experience</h3>
								<p>
									Without question, a native experience has many advantages over a web experience — we simply have more control. However, that doesn't mean your users will see it this way or even care. Regardless of their choices: native or web, Android or iPhone, when they use your service — you give them your best.
								</p>
								<p>
									Many of the benefits are minor but not insignificant. When you combine them all together, it removes unnecessary friction and makes the whole experience smoother. Reducing friction isn't just removing clicks or taps — a good design also presents its information clearly and along with its interactions.
								</p>
								<p>
									Are your hands a bit tied? No problem, use your phone's camera to scan in the number. Don't want to enter your credit card info, also not a problem, pay using Apple Pay or your Google Wallet — storing your info is a pain in the ass anyways. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Is your time running low? Let us help remind you, or better yet, automatically top you up if you do run out.

									A more connected system is great for both the city and its patrons.
								</p>
								<p>
									Having trouble finding a parking spot? No problem, the service can help you find a street that has an open spot. This sort of mapping can also be useful to the meter attendants. It enables them to see which streets are worth their time to patrol and which to avoid —  okay, so that's not so great for us.
								</p>
								<p>
									A connected system also means more customization. What if you don't understand English or your preferred language is something else. With dynamic content, this is not a problem — they can simply change the language. This is great for a city like Vancouver, which is very multi-cultural. 
								</p>
								<p>
									I'm sure many of us have had at least one mishap when parking at a meter. A smarter system means less user errors. Now we can prevent the user from paying if it's currently free or stop them from parking if they're currently not allowed. We can also help minimize any overpayments and better enforce any time restrictions placed on the stall.
								</p>
								<p>
									Of course this is just a small glimpse of what is possible when you switch to a digitize system that is both dynamic and flexible.
