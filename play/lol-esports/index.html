								<h2>League of Legends</h2>
								<h4>Refining the eSport Experience</h4>
								<p>
									The rise of eSports is just amazing, there are now millions who watch and follow competitve gaming. You might think it's just for hardcore gamers, but that's not the case. The past two finals of the League of Legends World Championships reported figures of 32 and 27 million unique viewers. To give you some perspective, the 2013 and 2014 NBA finals drew in 26 and 15.5 million respective viewers.
								</p>
								<p>
									While I personally don't play League of Legends, I do enjoy watching their professional eSport matches — they are very entertaining. Every game is unique, which keeps things fresh for the viewers and the players. If I were to put it in a more traditional sport sense, I really enjoy the eSport for its stories. Much like why I enjoy watching college basketball compared to the NBA — there's simply more drama.

									League of Legends, the eSport, has come a long way. Over the past few years the production quality has really increased. The stages and venues are now simply amazing and the broadcasters are now more experienced. As a viewer watching live or remotely, the whole experience now rivals that of any professional sport. However, that doesn't mean it's all perfect, there are still many areas that could be improved.
								</p>
								<p>
									One of my biggest complaints as a viewer, is just how much of the game is actually covered by the heads-up display (HUD). The HUD roughly <span class="change-slide" onclick="slides1.change(1)">takes up a third</span> of the total space. Do I always need all that info and just how valuable is it — what is primary, secondary, or even tertiary? The other problem is, to prevent the HUD from consuming even more space, the components are made as small as possible — this makes them incredibly hard to read. What if you simplified it down to the core essentials and removed the chrome around each component — no chrome equals bigger elements and these bigger elements don't consume any more space — <span class="change-slide" onclick="slides1.change(2)">this could be your default</span>.
								</p>
								<p>
									There are two different viewing experiences: those who watch the matches live at the venue and those who watch remotely via a live or post stream. The two experiences are actually quite different and have their own needs and challenges. However, the current solution is a compromise — the feed is neither optimal for those watching at the venue or those watching remotely.

									For the venues, Riot has the opportunity to build an environment to best suit their viewer's needs. It's possible to utilize multiple screens: one for the game, one for each player, one for stats and items, the possibilties are endless. They don't need to clutter their game feed with all that other info. However, for those who watch remotely it's a much different scenario. Riot has little to no control over the services that stream their feeds. A user can watch the match from a variety of sources and that is great, however, it means we're playing to the lowest common denominator and so our feed is cluttered.
								</p>
								<p>
									One of the better ways to watch a match is on Riot's own site rather than from YouTube or Twitch. I'd really love to see them take their own page to the next level and expand their capabilities. Allow your viewers access all sorts of information. It can help aspiring players get better and also help the casuals learn more about the game. Display those team and player stats, champion skill orders, their items, runes and glyphs. Free the game feed of all that extra info and work towards a system where the viewers can customize what they want to see.
