									I’m a designer and coder living in the beautiful city of Vancouver, BC. I love solving problems and being creative. I became a designer so I could help people have better experiences. Like many, I've been burned by bad products and shit services — let's change that. I can be reached via 
									<a href="mailto:kentmcheng@gmail.com">email</a>, 
									<a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/kentmcheng">LinkedIn</a>, or 
									<a href="https://twitter.com/kentmcheng">Twitter</a>.

								<h3>So What Makes a Good Designer?</h3>
								<p>
									A good designer is someone who not only considers the needs of the business or company, but also the needs of their customers. We are the advocates and evangelists for our users.
								</p>
								<p>
									Design is a balancing act. A good designer must be able to think things through analytically and holistically — solving specific or small problems without forgetting about the larger picture — it's the micro and the macro.
								</p>
								<p>
									A good designer also has humility — leave your ego at the door.  It’s not about you or I, it’s about us and we. It doesn’t matter who was right or wrong, it only matters that we’re doing our best. Even the smartest and most experienced designers won’t have all the answers, sometimes we need to explore and test. It's important to remember, you don’t have to fail to succeed, but you can’t succeed if you’re not willing to fail.

								<h3>What Makes a Good Team?</h3>
								<p>
									In this fast paced world, it’s how your team, handles and adapts to changes. A good team is agile and flexible — they understand the whole process. You won’t always know what will work and what doesn’t. Iterating quickly allows you to see what sticks and what doesn’t. If it’s bad it should be trashed. The work might be lost but result is we learned. A great team knows to continually move forward.

								<h3>More About Me</h3>
								<p>
									My other interests include: the coffee bean, pork fat in the form of bacon, listening to podcasts, playing games, and sports — both playing and watching.
								</p>

								<p>
									I’m a coffee geek — I prefer my drip coffee black from an <a href="http://aerobie.com/product/aeropress/">Aeropress</a> and when I can get pulled shots of espresso, I prefer them in the form of a latte from <a href="http://innocentcoffee.com/">Innocent Coffee</a>. A small piece of advice, if you buy your own beans and it doesn’t have a roast date — it’s not as nearly as fresh as you think!
								</p>
								<p>
									Who doesn’t like food? At the top of my list is bacon — it’s smokey, salty, fatty, and just plain delicious! If you want some awesome bacon you should really visit <a href="http://www.oyamasausage.ca/">Oyama Sausage</a> in Granville Island. If bacon isn’t your thing, they also have some of the best sausages and cured meats in town.
								</p>
								<p>
									Podcasts are my newest addiction. I love the medium for its news, updates, and discussions. It’s great listening to people have interesting and meaningful talks. Some of my current favorites are: <a href="http://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/">The Talk Show</a>, <a href="http://atp.fm/">Accidental Tech Podcast</a>, <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w">Back to Work</a>, <a href="http://5by5.tv/paleo">Latest in Paleo</a>, and <a href="http://podcasts.joerogan.net/">The Joe Rogan Experience</a>. The podcast that really got me started was the <a href="http://5by5.tv/talkshow">original Talk Show</a> with Dan Benjamin and Jon Gruber.
								</p>
								<p>
									So that just leaves games and sports — my first two passions growing up. I’ve always loved physical activity and playing sports provided me an early outlet to challenge myself. Perhaps that’s why I really love the solving problems and working with others. Games and especially sports allow you to exercise your brain and body in many different ways. My favorite sports are badminton, tennis, and volleyball. When it comes to games, there are just too many to name, however, my favorite genres are action RPGs and strategy based games.
								</p>
								<p>
									Interested in knowing more? Let’s continue this conversion over some coffee, or perhaps over some great craft beers, yum!
